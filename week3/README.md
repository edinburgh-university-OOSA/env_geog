# Week 3
  
This folder contains some potential answers for week 3's questions (teaching week 8). Below is a list of which questions are answered by which R script.

    **1.1)** fitLine.R
    **2.1)** correlation.R
    **2.2)** calibrateBiomass.R
    **3.1)** addCoords.R
    **3.2)** alignData.R
    **4.1)** calibrateBiomass.R
    **4.2)** mapBiomass.R
    **5.1)** valProcessGround.R
    **5.1)** valAddCoords.R
    **5.1)** validate.R

Some tasks are not solved in this code, but the answers for that should be solvable with code from the previous week.
