# Environmental Geography

This is the code for the University of Edinburgh's [Environmental Geography](http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/21-22/dpt/cxgegr08013.htm) module, for second year undergraduates. It will cover:

* Regional mapping with remote sensing data
* Know how to “upscale” ground data in R and QGIS
* Plan ground data collection
* Accuracy quantification to assess suitability for applications

Code is primarily in R, with some preparation scripts in Python.


## Regional mapping workflow
The suggested workflow to combine diameter at breast height (DBH) data with airborne laser scanning derived digital surface models (DSMs) and digital terrain models (DTMs) to map biomass. Combining :wq
